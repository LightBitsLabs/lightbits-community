## Overview

This repository contains many ways to deploy Lightbits cluster in virtualized environments.

Sometimes people just want to try Lightbits software to see how it works, what it can do.

Performant cluster requires bare-metal deployment with many resources that may not be available for customers
that just want to play with the system, try installation, upgrade, working against the API, etc...

## Current Virtual Environments

1. [All-In-One Vagrant deployment using libvirt provider.](./vagrant/README.md)

## Future Environments

1. Lightbits on kubernetes using Kube-Virt.
2. Lightbits on Openstack.
3. Lightbits on VMWare.
4. Lightbits on oVirt.
